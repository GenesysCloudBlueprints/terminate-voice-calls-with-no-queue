Genesys Cloud blueprints were built to help you jump-start building an application or integrating with a third-party partner. 
Blueprints are meant to outline how to build and deploy your solutions, not a production-ready turn-key solution.

This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint explains how to set up Genesys Cloud to terminate an outbound voice call that is not related to a queue and place an external tag on the call for analytics and follow-up.

When an Architect workflow receives a Communicate call trigger, Genesys Cloud makes multiple Public API calls to update the conversation with an external tag and then terminate the call.

:::primary
**Note:** Customers that want to leverage this blueprint **must** provide an alternate E911 solution for their agents as this blueprint removes the agents' ability to make an outbound PSTN call without associating a queue to the outbound call.

The following illustration shows the end-to-end user experience that this solution enables.

![End-to-end user experience](images/TerminateCallNoQueue.gif "End-to-end user experience")

## Solution components

* **Genesys Cloud** - A suite of Genesys cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. Contact center agents use the Genesys Cloud user interface.
* **Genesys Cloud API** - A set of RESTful APIs that enables you to extend and customize your Genesys Cloud environment.
* **Architect flows** - A flow in Architect, a drag and drop web-based design tool, dictates how Genesys Cloud handles inbound or outbound interactions.
* **Data Action** - Provides the integration point to invoke a third-party REST web service or AWS lambda.
* **CX as Code** - A Genesys Cloud Terraform provider that provides an interface for declaring core Genesys Cloud objects.

## Prerequisites

### Specialized knowledge

* Administrator-level knowledge of Genesys Cloud
* An understanding of how to use data actions
* Experience using Terraform

### Genesys Cloud account

* A Genesys Cloud CX 1 license. For more information, see [Genesys Cloud Pricing](https://www.genesys.com/pricing "Opens the Genesys Cloud pricing article").
* The Master Admin role in Genesys Cloud. For more information, see [Roles and permissions overview](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=24360 "Opens the Roles and permissions overview article") in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.
* CX as Code. For more information, see [CX as Code](https://developer.genesys.cloud/devapps/cx-as-code/ "Goes to the CX as Code page") in the Genesys Cloud Developer Center.

### Development tools running in your local environment

* Terraform (the latest binary). For more information, see [Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html "Goes to the Install Terraform page") on the Terraform website.

## Implementation steps

You can implement Genesys Cloud objects manually or with Terraform.
* [Configure Genesys Cloud using Terraform](#configure-genesys-cloud-using-terraform)
* [Configure Genesys Cloud manually](#configure-genesys-cloud-manually)

### Download the repository containing the project files

Clone the [terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue repository](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue "Goes to the terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue repository") in GitHub.

## Configure Genesys Cloud using Terraform

To allow Communicate/PBX calls between Genesys Cloud users, use the **/terraform-with-pbx** folder. Otherwise, use the **/terraform-without-pbx** folder.

### Set up Genesys Cloud

1. Set the following environment variables in a terminal window before you run this project using the Terraform provider:

   * `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_ID` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud client credential grant Id that CX as Code executes against. 
   * `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_SECRET` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud client credential secret that CX as Code executes against. 
   * `GENESYSCLOUD_REGION` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud region in your organization.

2. Set the environment variables in the folder where Terraform is running. 

### Configure your Terraform build

Set the following values in the **/terraform-{with/without}-pbx/dev.auto.tfvars** file, specific to your Genesys Cloud organization:

* `client_id` - The value of your OAuth Client ID using Client Credentials to be used for the data action integration.
* `client_secret`- The value of your OAuth Client secret using Client Credentials to be used for the data action integration.

The following is an example of the dev.auto.tfvars file.

```
client_id       = "your-client-id"
client_secret   = "your-client-secret"
```

### Run Terraform

The blueprint solution is now ready for your organization to use. 

1. Change to the **/terraform-with-pbx** or **/terraform-without-pbx** folder and issue the following commands:

   * `terraform init` - This command initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.  
   * `terraform plan` - This command executes a trial run against your Genesys Cloud organization and displays a list of all the Genesys Cloud resources Terraform created. Review this list and make sure that you are comfortable with the plan before you continue to the next step.
   * `terraform apply --auto-approve` - This command creates and deploys the necessary objects in your Genesys Cloud account. The `--auto-approve` flag provides the required approval before the command creates the objects.

After the `terraform apply --auto-approve` command successfully completes, you can see the output of the command's entire run along with the number of objects that Terraform successfully created. Keep the following points in mind:

   * This project assumes that you run this blueprint solution with a local Terraform backing state, which means that the `tfstate` files are created in the same folder where you run the project. Terraform recommends that you use local Terraform backing state files **only** if you run from a desktop or are comfortable deleting files.

   * As long as you keep your local Terraform backing state projects, you can tear down this blueprint solution. To tear down the solution, change to the `docs/terraform` folder and issue the  `terraform destroy --auto-approve` command. This command destroys all objects that the local Terraform backing state currently manages.

## Configure Genesys Cloud manually

### Create custom roles for use with Genesys Cloud OAuth clients

Create a custom role for use with a Genesys Cloud OAuth client with the following permissions.

:::primary
**Note:** Custom role 2 is only required if you want to enable Genesys Cloud users to make Communicate/PBX calls to other Genesys Cloud users.
:::

| Roles           | Permissions | Role Name |
|-----------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Custom role 1 | **Conversation** > **Communication** > **Disconnect**, **Conversation** > **ExternalTag** > **Edit**  | Terminate Conversation Public API |
| Custom role 2 | **Analytics** > **Conversation Detail** > **View** | Get Conversation Details Public API |

To create a custom role in Genesys Cloud:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **People & Permissions** > **Roles/Permissions** and click **Add Role**.

   ![Add a custom role](images/createRole.png "Add a custom role")

2. Enter the **Name** for your custom role.

   ![Name the custom role](images/nameCustomRole.png "Name the custom role")

3. Click the **Permissions** tab.

4. Search for the permissions that you want to assign to the custom role and select the check box next to each permission.
   ![Add permissions to the custom role](images/assignPermissionToCustomRole.png "Add permissions to the custom role")

5. Click **Save** to assign the appropriate permissions to your custom role.

   :::primary
   **Note:** Assign this custom role to your user before you create the Genesys Cloud OAuth client.
   :::

### Create an OAuth client for use with a Genesys Cloud data action integration

To enable a Genesys Cloud data action to make public API requests on behalf of your Genesys Cloud organization, use an OAuth client to configure authentication with Genesys Cloud.

Create an OAuth client for use with the data action integration with the following custom roles.

:::primary
**Note:** OAuth Client 2 is only required if you want to enable Genesys Cloud users to make Communicate/PBX calls to other Genesys Cloud users.
:::


| OAuth Client   | Custom role | OAuth Client Name |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| OAuth Client 1 | Terminate Conversation Public API | Terminate Conversation Public API |
| OAuth Client 2 | Get Conversation Details Public API | Get Conversation Details Public API |


To create an OAuth Client in Genesys Cloud:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Integrations** > **OAuth** and click **Add Client**.

   ![Add an OAuth client](images/2AAddOAuthClient.png "Add an OAuth client")

2. Enter the name for the OAuth client and select **Client Credentials** as the grant type. Click the **Roles** tab and assign the required role for the OAuth client.

   ![Select the custom role and the grant type](images/2BOAuthClientSetup2.png "Select the custom role and the grant type")

3. Click **Save**. Copy the client ID and the client secret values for later use.

   ![Copy the client ID and client secret values](images/2COAuthClientCredentials2.png "Copy the client ID and client secret values")

   :::primary
   **Note:** Ensure that you copy the client ID and client secret values for each of the OAuth clients.
   :::

### Add Genesys Cloud data action integration

Add a Genesys cloud data action integration for each OAuth client used with this blueprint to call the Genesys Cloud public API to:
* Terminate an outbound conversation that does not have a Queue ID
* Add an external tag to conversations terminated due to the missing Queue ID
* (Optional) Check if the outbound call is to another Genesys Cloud user

:::primary
**Note:** To check if the outbound call is to another Genesys Cloud user, you must create a second data action integration associated to OAuth Client 2.
:::

To create a data action integration in Genesys Cloud:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Integrations** > **Integrations** and install the **Genesys Cloud Data Actions** integration. For more information, see [About the data actions integrations](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=209478 "Opens the About the data actions integrations article") in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.

   ![Genesys Cloud data actions integration](images/3AGenesysCloudDataActionInstall.png "Genesys Cloud data actions integration")

2. Enter a name for the Genesys Cloud data action, such as Terminate Outbound Conversations With No Queue ID in this blueprint solution.

   ![Rename the data action](images/3BRenameDataAction.png "Rename the data action")

3. On the **Configuration** tab, click **Credentials** and then click **Configure**.

   ![Navigate to the OAuth credentials](images/3CAddOAuthCredentials.png "Navigate to the OAuth credentials")

4. Enter the client ID and client secret that you saved for the Terminate Conversation Public API [(OAuth Client 1)](#create-an-oauth-client-for-use-with-a-genesys-cloud-data-action-integration "Goes to the Create an OAuth client for use with a Genesys Cloud data action integration section"). Click **OK** and save the data action.

   ![Add OAuth client credentials](images/3DOAuthClientIDandSecret.png "Add OAuth client credentials")

5. Navigate to the Integrations page and set the Terminate Outbound Conversations With No Queue ID data action integration to **Active**.

   ![Set the data integration to active](images/3ESetToActive.png "Set the data action integration to active")

### Import the Genesys Cloud data actions

Import the following JSON files from the [terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue repo](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue/exports) GitHub repository:
* `Disconnect-Voice-Call.custom.json`
* `Put-Conversation-Tag.custom.json`
* (Optional) `Check-Conversation-For-PSTN-Leg.custom.json`

:::primary
**Note:** The optional data action is required if you want to enable Genesys Cloud users to make Communicate PBX calls to one another. This data action checks if the conversation has an external call leg to the PSTN. Repeat steps 1-3 with the `Check-Conversation-For-PSTN-Leg.custom.json` data action if you want to import this optional data action. Be sure to associate it with the Data Action Integration associated with the `Get Conversation Details Public API` [(OAuth Client 2)](#create-an-oauth-client-for-use-with-a-genesys-cloud-data-action-integration "Goes to the Create an OAuth client for use with a Genesys Cloud data action integration section").
:::

Import the `Disconnect-Voice-Call.custom.json` and `Put-Conversation-Tag.custom.json` files and associate them with the Terminate Outbound Conversations With No Queue ID data action integration, which uses the Terminate Conversation Public API OAuth client.

1. From the [terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue repo](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue/exports) GitHub repository, download the `Disconnect-Voice-Call.custom.json` file.

2. In Genesys Cloud, navigate to **Integrations** > **Actions** and click **Import**.

   ![Import the data action](images/4AImportDataActions.png "Import the data action")

3. Select the `Disconnect-Voice-Call.custom.json` file and associate it with the [Terminate Outbound Conversations With No Queue ID](#add-genesys-cloud-data-action-integrations "Goes to the Add Genesys Cloud data action integrations section") integration, and then click **Import Action**.

   ![Import the Disconnect Voice Call data action](images/4BImportDisconnectVoiceCallDataAction.png "Import the Disconnect Voice Call data action")


4. From the [terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue repo](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue/exports) GitHub repository, download the `Put-Conversation-Tag.custom.json` file.

5. In Genesys Cloud, navigate to **Integrations** > **Actions** and click **Import**.

   ![Import the data action](images/4AImportDataActions.png "Import the data action")

6. Select the `Put-Conversation-Tag.custom.json`file and associate it with the [Terminate Outbound Conversations With No Queue ID](#add-genesys-cloud-data-action-integrations "Goes to the Add Genesys Cloud data action integrations section") integration, and then click **Import Action**.

   ![Import the Put Conversation Tag data action](images/4BImportPutConversationTagDataAction2.png "Import the Put Conversation Tag data action")

### Import the Architect workflows

This solution includes the **Terminate Outbound Call Missing Queue.i3WorkFlow** Architect workflow that uses the two [data actions](#add-genesys-cloud-data-action-integration "Goes to the Add a web services data actions integration section"). This workflow terminates an outbound phone call if it does not have a Queue ID and updates the external tag on the conversation record to "No Queue".

The Event Orchestration trigger invokes this workflow. The workflow calls the Disconnect Voice Call and Put Conversation Tag data actions to update the outbound phone call.

To import the workflow in your Genesys Cloud organization, follow these steps:

1. Download the `Terminate Outbound Call Missing Queue.i3WorkFlow` file from the [terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue repo](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/terminate-voice-calls-with-no-queue/exports) GitHub repository.

   :::primary
   **Note:** If you want to allow Communicate/PBX calls between Genesys Cloud users, use the `Terminate Outbound Call Missing Queue with PSTN Call Leg Check.i3WorkFlow` file.
   :::

2. In Genesys Cloud, navigate to **Admin** > **Architect** > **Flows:Workflow** and click **Add**.

   ![Import the workflow](images/AddWorkflow1.png "Import the workflow")

3. Enter a name for the workflow and click **Create Flow**.

   ![Name your workflow](images/NameWorkflow1.png "Name your workflow")

4. From the **Save** menu, click **Import**.

   ![Import the workflow](images/ImportWorkflow1.png "Import the workflow")

5. Select the downloaded **Terminate Outbound Call Missing Queue.i3WorkFlow** file and click **Import**.

   ![Import your workflow file](images/SelectWorkflow1ImportFile.png "Import your workflow file")

6. Review your workflow. Click **Save** and then click **Publish**.

   ![Save your workflow](images/ImportedWorkflow1.png "Save your workflow")

   :::primary
   **Note:** If you want to change the external tag, replace **No Queue** in the **externalTagName** field with the string of your choice.
   :::

   :::primary
   **Note:** If you imported the `Terminate Outbound Call Missing Queue with PSTN Call Leg Check.i3WorkFlow` file, your workflow will look as follows: 
   :::

   ![Save your workflow](images/ImportedWorkflow2.png "Save your workflow")

   
## Create the event orchestration triggers

Create the trigger that invokes the created Architect workflow.

1. From Admin Home, search for **Triggers** and navigate to the Triggers list.

   ![Navigate to Triggers](images/NavigateToTriggers.png "Navigate to Triggers")

2. From the Triggers list, click **Add Trigger**.

   ![Add Trigger](images/AddTrigger.png "Add Trigger")

3. In the Add New Trigger window, name your trigger and click **Add**.

   ![Name Trigger](images/NameTrigger.png "Name Trigger")

4. Under **Topic Name**, select **v2.detail.events.conversation.{id}.user.start**. 

5. Under **Workflow Target**, select **Terminate Outbound Call Missing Queue**.  

6. Leave **Data Format** as **TopLevelPrimitives**.  

7. Click **Add Condition**. For more information, see [Available Topics](https://developer.genesys.cloud/notificationsalerts/notifications/available-topics "Opens the Available Topics article") in the Genesys Cloud Developer Center.  To monitor the notifications, use the notification monitoring tool in the Developer Center.

  ![Configure Trigger](images/ConfigureTrigger.png "Configure Trigger")

8. Under **JSON Path**, type **queueId**.

9. Under **Operator**, select **Exists** and set the **Value** toggle to **False**. 

10. Click **Create**.

   ![Configure Trigger Criteria](images/ConfigureTriggerCriteria.png "Configure Trigger Criteria")

   :::primary
   **Note:** If you want to allow PBX calls to other Genesys Cloud users, add the following criteria to your trigger to use the simpler `Terminate Outbound Call Missing Queue.i3WorkFlow` file for your Architect workflow. This reduces the amount of time between the trigger's firing and the call's disconnect. Adjust the string in the **Contains** condition to match your business needs, especially if your agents call specific country codes.
   :::

   ![Additional Trigger Criteria](images/AdditionalTriggerCriteria.png "Additional Trigger Criteria")

11. Set the **Active** toggle to **Active**. 

12. Click **Save**.

   ![Activate Trigger](images/ActivateTrigger.png "Activate Trigger")
